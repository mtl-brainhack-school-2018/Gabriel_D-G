# Background

This year I just finished my undergraduate studies in neuroscience and I am now starting a master degree this summer at the Douglas institute. For my master, I will be investigating functional connectivity in a mouse model of neuropsychiatric disorder, the model of maternal immune activation (MIA), and this based on resting-state fMRI scans acquired in mice under anesthesia. The MIA model consists in triggering an immune response in pregnant dams during gestation, which has been shown to reproduce various phenotypic features of schizophrenia and autism in the offsprings throughout their development.

# Next step

To study functional connectivity in this model, I will need to develop appropriate protocols for scan acquisition and anesthesia induction and maintenance, and in particular learn how to appropriately conduct pre-processing of fMRI data and subsequent analysis of functional connectivity.

# Specific learning objectives

At brainhack school, I intend to learn to apply fMRI preprocessing pipelines to resting-state fMRI datasets and conduct functional connectivity analysis. More specifically, this includes:
* Learning to implement NIAK, understand its documentation, and maybe another preprocessing pipeline (FSL, fmriprep) on a open source BIDS dataset of rs-fmri
* Learn the good practice of QC procedures
* Learn to conduct independent component analysis (ICA) and seed-based correlation analysis to map the default mode network
* Practice my coding skills for data visualization, manipulation, and also learn to use Docker for containerized applications
* If I have the time, try to conduct a similar analysis on an online dataset of fMRI data from a mouse study
